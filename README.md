This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Form-Builder

Generates a form component depending on what choices you have selected and input.
You can test it out in action **[here](http://blayneformbuilder.surge.sh/)**.

## Todo

- Add ability to choose if you want to use react-bootstrap or not.
- Debugging with radio/checkboxes
- Style it up so you can import some styles.
- ~~Clean up the code, need to figure out how to remove the comma's, and ideally fix spacing.~~
- ~~Add some documentation~~
- ~~Add button to show/hide the code~~
- ~~Disclaimer about spaces before/after semi-colon on value input.~~
